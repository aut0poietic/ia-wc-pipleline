			<h2><span class="small">01</span> <a name="01">What is this about?</a></h2>
			<p class="lead">
				So apparently, there are these things called <em>Web Components.</em>
			</p>
			<p>
				Who knew&hellip;
			</p>
			<p>
				What with all the <em>React's</em>, <em>Vue's</em> and <em>Svelte's</em> (oh, my) I think I could be
				forgiven for not paying attention, despite the apparent controversies.
			</p>
			<p>
				This year, I began planning a fairly complex project: A special-purpose &quot;static site generator&quot;
				with an interactive visual editor. The editor was designed to create something not unlike a visual novel
				&mdash; heavy on the animation and interactivity; dynamic, branching story lines; a pluggable system for
				adding new elements and templates. Oh, and it had to communicate via a standardized specification.
			</p>

			<p>
				ReactJS was the first and obvious choice for creating this. However I quickly ran into issues. I found
				myself falling down a rabbit hole of react running react running react&hellip; When my experimental
				projects started weighing in at multiple MB, I realized React was not the way forward for the static
				site. Many of my target audience had project size quotas of under 4MB.
			</p>
			<aside class="pullquote"><span>I landed on VanillaJS for it's speed and size.</span></aside>
			<p>
				I entertained the others briefly but landed on VanillaJS for the static site and React for the editor
				itself. But having experienced the speed of development that React and similar tools allow, I had a hard
				time stomaching the idea of developing the entire project without some form of reactive framework. I
				started looking around for smaller so-called &quot;micro-frameworks&quot; to see if I could ease the
				transition and stumbled onto <a href="https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/" target="_blank">LitElement</a>
				and Web Components.
			</p>
			<p>
				The idea was that I could build pre-built web components as plugins that are already in their final
				state -- all the editor has to do is provide the data/children. There are some fairly significant
				technical hurdles (like teaching the editor what properties & children are valid and what values they
				accept), but if React can treat a Web Component tag like any other HTML tag, the entire project just
				became significantly easier to build.
			</p>
			<p>
				The problem is that I came to this from LitElement's (and to a lesser extent, React's) perspective. I
				know nothing about Web Components as a technology, how they work, how they live nor whether they're
				viable. There are a lot of opinions on what components are and what they're useful for or whether
				they're useful at all.
			</p>
			<p>
				Blindly accepting the opinions of the peanut gallery seems like a bad idea. What's a developer to do?

			<h2><span class="small">02</span> <a name="02">Throwing it All Away</a></h2>
			<p class="lead">
				This repo is a series of simple experiments for me to explore developing web components to solve the
				needs of the project I described above.
			</p>
			<p>
				I assume nothing, throwing out every shred of conventional wisdom, every so-called best practice and all
				of the words of any venerated expert.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am intentionally re-treading ground, often doing things that are completely, mind-bogglingly moronic.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is all so I can produce components that:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Generate self-contained components that can be used anywhere with no dependencies that are extremely
					small.
				</li>
				<li>
					Identify the build tooling to allow for one-component-per-js-file, with multiple components living
					in the same project.
				</li>
				<li>
					Refine the tooling to allow for writing CSS, JavaScript and HTML in their own files (no
					CSS/HTML-in-JS) that are bundled into a single component file with no overhead.
				</li>
				<li>
					Standardize the tooling and configuration so it can live happily within another framework's build
					config transparently.
				</li>
				<li>
					Utilize the component as content within another application built with React, Vue or Svelte as if it
					were any other HTML tag. This requires that the parent application manipulate the attributes and
					children of the components naturally.
				</li>
				<li>
					Augment the components with compatible technologies: Workers, Assembly, whatever.
				</li>
				<li>
					Fail, publicly.
				</li>
				<li>
					Have fun building silly experiments I don't ordinarily get to do at the Day Job&trade;.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				As I've progressed in this, I've divided the experiments up into sections:

					This is an intentionally stupid attempt at using Webpack to build a web component with no
					specialized tooling or build process. The only non-standard webpack bit is the <code>css-to-string-loader</code>.
					As you'd expect with an attempt named &quot;stupid&quot;, it didn't go so well.

					The primary issue is <strong>size</strong>. LitElement is a 3K library &mdash; if you don't count
					the <strong>17 other files</strong> that are included via, well, <code>include</code>. In the end,
					LitElement weighs in at around 43K, all files included. Once Webpack adds in it's overhead, then
					minifies the whole thing, the resulting file is 22K.
				</p>
				<p>
					On top of this are issues with the nature of webpack and LitElement. Both are much happier using
					css-in-js which was completely counter to the goal. Webpack dumps the entire css file in a variable,
					which has to be assigned to a class property on the component. In order to make that kludge work,
					the entire CSS file has to be passed through LitHTML's <code>unsafeCSS</code> method. The resulting
					<abbr title="Flash of Unstyled Content">FOUC</abbr> was extreme.

					This example is a reduced text case version of the previous Webpack build process. The idea was to
					strip out anything that could be inflating the file size and see what the bundled code would look
					like.
				</p>
				<p>
					In light of that, I removed LitElement, building the component natively and went with CSS &amp; HTML
					in the JavaScript (even though it's counter to my goals and the way I enjoy writing code). I took
					the time to hand-minify the HTML &amp; CSS as Webpack can't minify the content of strings.

				</div>
				<p>
					The result was worth one of those face-palm moments.
				</p>
				<p>
					Obviously, the reduced test case worked, producing a bundle file was 2K. If you think of the result
					compared to the LitElement's 22K, it'd be understandable if you saw this as a successful test.
				</p>
				<p>
					But seeing as the original file was just slightly less than 1K, a final bundle of 2K is not an
					acceptable result. <strong>Minification should not increase the size of the bundle</strong>.
				</p>
				<p>
					It's also throwing out all the goals of the project itself.

					This example is the same reduced text case version that substitutes RollUp over webpack. I noticed
					that LitElement uses RollUp in most of it's examples. In any project, it's hard to know if the
					choice was one based on preference, politics or if there's a valid reason for the choice.
				</p>
				<p>
					Again, I removed LitElement, building the component natively and used CSS &amp; HTML in the

				<p>
					This reduced test case was more what I expected from the previous attempt.
				</p>
				<p>
					The final bundle is smaller but not significantly so, which is to be expected from this test &mdash;
					the majority of the &lsquo;weight&rsquo; of the file is located in the CSS &amp; HTML and there
					should be some minification gains beyond what I could produce by hand with a purpose-built build

					Once again, this is the same component in previous examples, however this time around I moved the
					CSS to it's own file and removed my hand-minification. The HTML is a simple template literal. The
					CSS is loaded using the usual <code>import</code> statement and the variable the style were loaded
					into placed into the template placeholder.

				<p>
					The result worked so well, I went ahead and included PostCSS with autoprefixer and flex-bugs-fixes,
					which is why the bundle file is slightly larger than the previous experiment.
				</p>
				<p>
					Even better, the final, minified code is surprisingly clean. Unlike Webpack, RollUp did away with
					the import for the CSS and injected it directly into the template string after running it through
					PostCSS.
				</p>
				<p>In the end, this is a fairly usable configuration and shows the way for further development.</p>

					The result here is fairly lack-luster. Like Webpack, Rollup bundled the entire LitElement package
					into the final file. Worse, Rollup refused to inline the CSS as it had in the native example. The
					build failed until I wrapped the imported CSS with <code>unsafeCSS</code>.
				</p>

					It's a case of &quot;one-step-forward, one-step-back.&quot; In the end, this has soured me on the

					I'd say this is the first fully-successful attempt to create something I could use for a production
					project. I'm a little concerned at the size of the toggle component, but I'm putting that down to
					sloppy coding &mdash; Seriously, it's embarrassingly bad and the accessibility model is useless
					without JavaScript and likely fails in most browsers.
				</p>
				<p>
					Still, it does precisely what I wanted with external CSS, and each file in it's own directory, with
					each as it's own entry point. This produces a file that can be used anywhere.
				</p>
				<p>
					I had so much fun with the attempt that I went ahead and wired the two together, with the toggle's
					state determining the value of the card's title. It's a stupid bit of script, but it has almost
					convinced me that web component can be a viable development tool.

					I liked the idea of an image carousel that "split" the image when animating between images. I had in

					the final result is still pretty useful.

					The carousel is actually made up of two different components, both bundled into the same file as
					they cannot be used separately. I managed to refine the build process so that I could write the
					JavaScript, CSS &amp; <strong>HTML</strong> in separate files.
				</p>
				<p>
					I built in the ability to turn off both the next/previous navigation and the &quot;bullets&quot;
					that appear below the images to control and indicate the current slide. Because of this I invested
					some time in the accessibility of the component, reviewing the
					<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/" target="_blank">ARIA Authoring Practices</a> and
					implementing a dual-model for the component.
				</p>
				<p>
					Without bullets, the carousel uses the group role to define the slides behavior, and the
					next/previous buttons control the component. When the bullets are turned on, the accessibility model
					shifts to that of a Tab/TabPanel with supplemental navigation.
				</p>
				<p>
					I ensured that the external attributes <code>navigation</code>, <code>buttons</code>, and <code>index</code>
					can all be manipulated using external Javascript. This should allow another framework to control and
					potentially build a carousel as if it were HTML. I also took the time to build a fallback for if
					JavaScript is turned off or if the component itself is not supported. But this revealed a problem&hellip;
				</p>
				<p>
					Web Components are JavaScript; all of the structure and styles are implemented in JavaScript and if
					JavaScript is not enabled, there's no way to control the appearance of the component when it fails
					<em>from within the component</em>. So the fallback can't be bundled with the component itself.
				</p>
				<aside class="pullquote left"><span>The fallback for a component can't be bundled within the component itself.</span>
				</aside>
				<p>
					At this point, I'm implementing the fallback in the hosting HTML, using <code>ia-carousel:not(:defined)</code>
					styles. The pattern I chose reveals only the image for the first slide, and attribute content to
					handle the title of the slide. The fallback style sets the image for the slide as the background
					image, but if I were to redesign the component, I'd likely use a <code>slide:before{ content:
					attr(src); }</code> instead.
				</p>
				<p>
					I'm not sure how to handle the fallback, short of providing a fallback.css file that accompanies the
					component. It's counter to the single 'universal' file for each component, but it at least would
					help end-users using the component have a useful, default fallback strategy.
